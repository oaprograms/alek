			<h3>What is Divine Massage Therapy?</h3>
			<p>Divine Massage Therapy improves the functioning of the entire body from head-to-toe and provides great relief in a short period of time. Changes can be felt immediately following the first session and even more so after a few days. </p>
			<p>Depending on an individual's overall level of health, some people may experience short term symptoms of illness as the body detoxes and realigns itself after the first or second treatment. This is actually a good sign that the body is reacting favorably to the massage.</p>

			<h2>Divine Massage Therapy – Where East Meets West</h2>
			<p>Divine Massage Therapy utilizes traditional techniques of massage from East and West - Orient and Occident, taking the best parts from each and synergistically combining them together for a more well-balanced holistic massage.</p>
			<p>From the West, are the more familiar therapeutic and relaxation massage techniques which focus more on softening and relaxing the muscles and soft tissue, and from the East, are the methods of re-adjusting the alignment of the skeleton and bone-joint structures. </p>
			<p>These two approaches work well together vice-versa like ‘Yin and Yang.’ The more the muscles and soft tissue are able to loosen up and relax, the easier it becomes to align the bones and joints of the skeleton into their proper position. Conversely, if the bones and joints are properly aligned, the easier it is for the muscles and tendons to maintain a relaxed state.</p>
			<p>The synergy created between the two approaches of East and West combined with the extensive experience and intuition of the practitioner is what makes this type of massage so powerful and beneficial.</p>

			<h3>Re-Aligning and Re-Adjusting the Pelvic Region</h3>
			<p>The theory behind this type of therapy is that by balancing out both sides of the body, one can not only correct existing problems but also avoid potential issues in the future.</p>
			<p>Ideally, each leg holds the balance equally between the two halves of the body but most people do not have the weight of their body equally separated between their two legs. According to some statistics, almost 95% of people have an improperly lodged pelvis. </p>
			<p>Such imbalances are often caused from the moment of birth. Based on research done at the International Institute of Preventive Medicine in Tokyo in 1990, an improper position of the mother's pelvic belt can cause the same anomaly in the child during birth. Therefore, it is important to correct the pelvic region of expectant mothers so as to prevent similar imbalance in the child.</p>
			<p>According to the theory, the most significant area of the body is the pelvic region. An imbalance originating in the pelvic region can create problems elsewhere in the body, such as deviations in the spine and deformation of the hip bones. </p>
			<p>During the movement of the bone-joint-muscle structures of an imbalanced pelvis, one leg may become visibly ‘longer’ than the other. This can cause muscles to tighten up in the pelvic region and potentially cause problems in other areas of the body as it tries to compensate. This also reflects on the functionality of the body as a whole and can potentially be the cause of various illnesses.</p>
			<p>Therefore, the central aim of divine massage therapy is to correct the position of the pelvic bones, the sacrum and hip joints, and to properly align the spine and release any tension or blockages in the muscles and soft tissue. This also serves to boost the immune system and re-balance functioning of the internal organs.</p>
