				Spine Exercises
			</h3>
			<p>
				Your spine is one of the most important parts of your body. It gives your
				body structure and support. Without it you could not stand up or keep
				yourself upright. As long as you don’t have problems with back pain you
				really may not be so aware of its importance, but if you do experience
				difficulty and pain with your back then suddenly you become aware of just
				how important the spine is. Back pain, as ordinary as it may sound, can
				really cause some serious problems which can prevent you from leading a
				normal life.
			</p>
			<p>
				Fortunately, there are powerful physical therapies and exercises which are
				specifically designed for keeping the spine in optimal shape and to relieve
				pain.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Lumbar Spine Exercises
			</h3>
			<p>
				Statistics say that about 20% of the population has never had back pain.
				However, the remaining 80% of the world population has or has had some kind
				of back problems which interrupt their normal everyday life. Many of these
				people have developed such serious problems that they end up seeking
				medical advice and help.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once we feel the pain, we usually make a vow that we’ll do whatever it
				takes to keep it from happening again. We say that we’ll stick to the
				regular exercises or avoid those situations which are harmful, but what
				usually ends happening? Life gets in the way and we forget – always putting
				it behind us until it flares up again.
			</p>
			<p>
				People usually practice just until the time the pain fades away. Some
				continue a little longer and then return to their old bad habits that
				caused the problems; behaviors such as prolonged sitting in front of the
				computer without moving or a daily schedule without much physical activity.
				As a result the pain comes back and the cycle starts all over again.
			</p>
			<p>
				To really break free from this cycle takes a strong commitment and some
				self- discipline but with the right set of exercises, it can be easier than
				might be expected.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Lumbar - Sacral Spine Exercises
			</h3>
			<p>
				There are many great exercises for the back with the goal of increasing
				mobility of the spine, strengthening the back and abdominal muscles, and
				stabilizing the spinal column. Strengthening the back muscles is essential
				because these muscles hold our spine.
			</p>
			<p>
				These exercises can be done in order to prevent pain in the lumbar-sacral
				spine, but also to maintain good health and working ability. Back pain can
				make any type of work difficult or even impossible in some cases. Even some
				of the simplest activities can become problematic.
			</p>
			<p>
				Every person is unique, so in figuring what exercises will work best for
				you, it is recommended that you consult with a physiotherapist or other
				health professional.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Spine Exercises - Practicing
			</h3>
			<p>
				An exercise program which is designed to help strengthen of
				pelvitrohanteric muscles is absolutely essential for anyone. Such exercises
				must be done properly and paced out over time with a pause between each
				exercise every one minute.
			</p>
			<p>
				After pain is reduced or eliminated, the beginning of kinesis therapy
				procedures is necessary and from that point, a complete recovery depends on
				how much work the patient is ready to commit to.
			</p>
			<p>
				Exercise can help us to get rid of the pain, but it is also essential to
				keep practicing regularly.
			</p>
			<h3>
				How To Treat A Herniated Disc?
			</h3>
			<p>
				According to some studies, approximately 80% of the world's population
				suffers from a herniated disc or some kind of damage to the intervertebral
				discs in the spine, which can be caused by degenerative changes or
				injuries.
			</p>
			<p>
				Due to the contemporary life style and habits that we have, disc herniation
				is more common in young adults. In order to cure a herniated disk it is
				necessary to avoid the strains and movements that worsen the condition and
				treatment can take a long time. The most common method of treatment is a
				physical therapy that focuses specifically on the painful area, thus
				improving the function of the spine.
			</p>
			<p>
				When therapy is first applied, improvements may be noticed in short time,
				leading to a significant reduction of pain and increase of mobility. Once
				the complete therapy is finished, the patient may feel that the pain is
				completely gone and regain full mobility. At such point, the patient can
				return to his normal life and managing of their everyday work and
				activities.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Scoliosis
			</h3>
			<p>
				Scoliosis, literally means - curved spine. It can be distorted in the upper
				part, the lumbar area, or even a double curved. In medical terms, scoliosis
				is a three-dimensional deformity of the spine, and is a lateral curvature
				of the spine, which may be accompanied by vertebral rotation and thus the
				deformation of the thorax. Consequently, the pelvis can be bad-centered, as
				well as the shoulders.
			</p>
			<p>
				For this reason, an imbalance that occurs can affect the entire body and
				all movements from standing, sitting or lying down. Scoliosis may be
				structural or functional. In the former, the spine bends to one side, and
				the vertebrae rotate pulling the ribs. As a result of this, a hump appears
				gibbously. A double curve is referred to as ‘S scoliosis.’
			</p>
			<h3>
				Treatment Of Scoliosis
			</h3>
			<p>
				<em><strong></strong></em>
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Scoliosis</em>
				is a <em>medical</em> condition in which a person's <em>spine</em> has a
				sideways <em>curve</em>, and is also an extremely widespread disease of the
				spine. It is a progressive disease, in which the curvature of the spine can
				become larger over time unless treatment is applied.
			</p>
			<p>
				Scoliosis usually occurs during the growth of children between 10 and 17
				years of age, and after completion of growth, scoliosis is sometimes
				partially stabilized. Due to a rapid growth, some back muscles remain short
				on one side, while on the other side they are extended, causing the spine
				to bend and cause the entire backbone to curve in the form of the letter S.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you are reading this text, sitting at your computer, ask yourself how
				much you actually sit down during the day? Scoliosis can occur simply by
				excessive sitting, because while we sit, pressure on the spine from the
				pelvis is two-and-a-half times greater than when standing, which would mean
				that if you sit all day, your spine is almost three times more strained
				than when standing or walking. It is important to stop the progression of
				the deformity and to maintain the achieved correction. There are
				conservative and surgical treatments, which are usually taken as a last
				resort.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Kyphosis
			</h3>
			<p>
				In short, kyphosis is gibbousness. This is actually an increase in the
				normal curvature of the spine, and usually found in the thoracic part of
				spine. Kyphosis is usually caused by bad habits such as irregular and
				prolonged sitting which can lead to pain in the neck and shoulder-blade and
				cause the inability of long-term holding of the upright position of the
				body.
			</p>
			<p>
				How does a person who suffers from kyphosis look? The head is bent forward,
				shoulders are bent, wings blades are lifted, back is humped, the stomach is
				weak and flabby, and lumbar part is too curved.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Lordosis
			</h3>
			<p>
				The term <em>lordosis</em> means inward curving of a part of the lumbar and
				cervical vertebral column. Lordotic posture is a disorder signified by an
				increase of the spine curve in the frontal direction. Lordosis and kyphosis
				are often associated.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Spine Exercises
			</h3>
			<p>
				Now that we are familiar with the most common problems of the spinal
				column, let’s discuss how we can help solve them. Kinesis is a method of
				treatment which uses movement as a tool for overcoming pain, while
				simultaneously employing exercises to correct the problem.
			</p>
			<p>
				The point of Kinesis is to use specific exercises that correct deformities
				and poor posture as well as prevent the occurrence of such problems. There
				are deformities such as protruding or sunken chest, straight back, O or X
				legs, as well as flat feet. However, the most common problems are
				deformities of the spine.
			</p>
			<p>
				By the application of corrective exercises during the treatment,
				long-lasting results are achieved. Back pain disappears, postural asymmetry
				is corrected, the angle of curvature is reduced, and in some cases it is
				even possible to achieve such positive results with elderly persons.
			</p>
			<p>
				These corrective exercises create a balance between opposing muscle groups,
				and the both sides of the body, helping you achieve continuous improvement
				regarding proper posture and overall awareness of your body.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Corrective Exercises - Practicing
			</h3>
			<p>
				The physical therapist will pay particular attention to the alignment and
				stabilization of the body, while the use of auxiliary equipment such as a
				ball or balancers, can contribute to even better results for improving
				posture.
			</p>
			<p>
				Strengthening of weakened muscles of the trunk leads to greater stability
				of the spine, and stretching of shortened muscles improves body alignment.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Treatment Of Herniated Disc
			</h3>
			<p>
				We've all heard of the herniated disc. This disease of the spine usually
				occurs between thirty and fifty years of age, and the reason for this is
				that the natural aging process begins at an early age. It is not unusual to
				find people, even as young as twenty years old, who also have problems with
				a herniated disc.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Herniated Disc In Lumbal Part Of The Spine
			</h3>
			<p>
				The most common symptoms of the disease are pain in the lower back,
				numbness, or pain that runs down the leg up to the little finger of the
				foot, pain in the knee or around it. It also can be associated with failure
				to control the urination, failure to control the feet, sexual dysfunction,
				burning feet or feelings of cold feet.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another symptom is pain which occurs while moving the torso, such as
				stretching, bending, or rotating. There can be also pain in the calves,
				causing the overall posture to be distorted.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Symptoms Of Herniated Disc In The Neck
			</h3>
			<p>
				Symptoms vary depending on which part of the spine has the problem, whether
				it is in the lumbar or cervical part of the spine. In regards to the
				problems in the cervical part, there may be pain in the arms and shoulders,
				painful and restricted movements of the neck, numbness of the hands and
				fingers, ringing in the ears, headaches and migraines, pain between the
				shoulder blades, fatigue, dizziness and nausea, and if contact with the
				spinal cord occurs, there can even be pain throughout the whole body.
			</p>
			<h3>
				How To Treat Disc Herniation?
			</h3>
			<p>
				One common treatment for a herniated disc employs the use of analgesics;
				drugs for reducing pain and inflammation, relative resting, and cooling in
				the loin area (not heating, as this may cause even more inflammation and
				stronger nerve pain).
			</p>
			<h3>
				Treatment Of Disc Herniation - Practicing
			</h3>
			<p>
				Discus hernia occurs due to excessive strains and insufficient relief of
				the spine. Nourishment of the discs works on the principle of sponges,
				because they have no blood vessels. When the body is in the upright
				position, it increases the pressure on them; pressing out harmful
				substances, while during the resting or sitting with the backrest at an
				angle of 45 degrees, the pressure decreases and nutrients enter the discs.
			</p>
			<p>
				The pace of modern life is such that most people sit or stand too much, so
				the spine is overloaded, and without relief it can lead to faster
				deterioration of discs due to their poor nourishment. Poor posture, obesity
				and smoking, also negatively affect the spine, and with a lack of physical
				activity the muscles become weak, which are important because they hold the
				spine.
			</p>
			<p>
				If the condition is serious and symptoms become overwhelming and common
				treatments do not give the desired results, then an operation may be
				considered. There is also an urgent surgical treatment, when the patient
				has weakness in the legs, lack of urination and defecation, or inability to
				retain them. Symptoms include muscle weakness, or inability to walk on the
				toes or on the heel of one foot.
			</p>
			<p>
				Surgery always carries some risk, so it is necessary to do everything
				possible to avoid it, which means taking care of the spine daily through
				regular exercise and physical activity. The good news is that most people
				adopt this rule, so disk herniation surgery can be avoided.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Treatment Of Spondylosis
			</h3>
			<p>
				Aging is the predominant <em>cause of spondylosis</em>, also known as
				spinal arthritis.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you’ve ever heard and elderly person complain about neck problems, it is
				very possible that this is spondylosis. Cervical spine spondylosis is a
				disorder usually associated with aging, primarily affecting joints in the
				neck.
			</p>
			<h3>
				How Does Spondylosis Develop?
			</h3>
			<p>
				Spondylosis usually develops as a result of wear and tear of cartilage and
				bone in the neck area of the spine. As mentioned before, it mostly affects
				older persons, but it can also be caused by other factors.
			</p>
			<h3>
				What Are Some Other Terms For Spondylosis?
			</h3>
			<p>
				Spondylosis may also be referred to as a disorder of the cervical spine,
				ossification of the neck, ossification of the cervical spine, cervical
				osteoarthritis, or cervical spondylosis.
			</p>
			<h3>
				What Are The Causes Of Spondylosis?
			</h3>
			<p>
				The causes of spondylosis are degenerative changes in the vertebrae and
				disks, which are exacerbated by aging, changes such as dehydration of
				discs, disc herniation, the development of bone spurs (growths), and
				stiffness of the ligaments.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another cause is when discs between the vertebrae become dry and begin to
				shrink, usually at the time when a person enters the fortieth year of age,
				thus reducing the effect of the disks as "cushions" between the bones in
				the neck. As we age, the discs may also develop cracks. In this way, the
				disc can distort or hernia occurs thus displacing the disc from its
				intervertebral space.
			</p>
			<p>
				Bone growths create extra pressure on the spinal cord and nerves, causing
				you to feel pain in the joints. You also may have pain or difficulty when
				trying to move the neck or moving the neck.
			</p>
			<h3>
				What Are The Symptoms Of Spondylosis?
			</h3>
			<p>
				Symptoms of spondylosis may occur suddenly or develop gradually and develop
				in intensity which can range from mild to serious.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first and primary symptoms are pain and stiffness of the neck. Pain
				behind the shoulder can also be common. People with spondylosis also
				complain of pain along the hands and fingers, as well as pain which
				increases during sitting, standing, sneezing, coughing or when a person
				moves their neck back. Addiotional symptoms include headaches in the
				occipital part of the head, and tingling or numbness, which can be felt in
				the arms and shoulders, but which may also occur in the legs.
			</p>
			<h3>
				How To Treat Spondylosis?
			</h3>
			<p>
				The first goal of any type of treatment for spondylosis is to alleviate the
				pain, then to reduce the risk of permanent damage to the extent that it
				allows the person to lead a normal life.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you have been diagnosed with spondylosis, you will first be referred to
				physical therapy. It will make your neck and shoulder muscles stronger, and
				at the same time it will help them to stretch better. The physical
				therapist can also apply treatments which aim to improve the traction of
				the neck, usually performed with the use of weights to increase the space
				between the neck joints, and to relieve pressure on the discs and nerves of
				the cervical spine. As a result, you will feel the reduction or
				disappearance of pain.
			</p>
			<p>
				Also, spondylosis conditions may be treated by using medications, such as
				painkillers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, muscle relaxants which
				treat muscle spasms, corticosteroids, in the form of steroid injections for
				pain, and epilepsy medications to relieve pain caused by nerve damage, as
				well as anti-depressants.
			</p>
			<p>
				The good news is that such treatments described above quite often give the
				desired results and there is no need for surgical treatment. However, in
				some rarer cases, surgical procedures may be deemed necessary.
			</p>
			<p>
				This usually occurs in situations where the patient's condition is serious,
				and when he did not react to previous treatment measures. Surgery may
				involve removing part of the vertebrae, discs or bony growths, in order to
				create more space for the spinal cord and nerve.
			</p>
			<p>
				If by reading this, you’ve recognized some of the symptoms in yourself, it
				is a good idea to consult with a therapist in order to make necessary
				check-ups, and if there is a diagnosis of spondylosis so that treatment can
				promptly be applied.
			</p>
			<h3>
				What is Scoliosis?
			</h3>
			<p>
				Having scoliosis means to have a curved spine. It can be present in a
				couple of ways, such as when the spine is twisted to the left or to the
				right, C-shaped, or in a double curve shape like the letter S.
			</p>
			<p>
				Very often it is seen in kids, at an early age, but it can also be found
				during adolescence, when the child suddenly experiences a massive growth
				spurt. It can affect children during puberty, but also after completion of
				growth. Of course, the scoliosis is present at adults, also.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Is Scoliosis Hereditary?
			</h3>
			<p>
				Maybe your child has scoliosis and now you're wondering whether you might
				be responsible for it. Doctors say, based on experience and research, that
				if one of the parents or both, have had some deformity of the spine, it is
				likely that the child will also have such a problem.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you already know there is a genetic predisposition for such a problem,
				then it would be wise to follow the growth of the spine of your child,
				starting from an early age. In this way, if you ever notice any unusual
				changes, you can respond in a timely manner.
			</p>
			<h3>
				What Are The Causes Of Scoliosis?
			</h3>
			<p>
				The cause of scoliosis in many cases may be attributed to an incorrect
				sitting posture or bad posture in general. However, in some cases, its
				causes may be unknown and its progression can be unpredictable, which makes
				treatment quite difficult. If there is any problem in the joints and
				muscles at birth and during the first year of life, and it was not timely
				and completely rehabilitated as a result, deformity of the spine can occur.    <em></em>
			</p>
			<h3>
				How To Diagnose Scoliosis?
			</h3>
			<p>
				In order to determine whether or not a child has scoliosis, a physician
				will exam a child without clothes, with his back turned. He will look at
				shoulder height to see if it one shoulder is lower than the other, which
				would therefore indicate the blade on that side is also lower. In relation
				to the other blade it may appear a bit separated.
			</p>
			<p>
				A doctor will also exam the vertebrae with the hands to feel if they are
				not in a straight line. There may be also an asymmetry of triangles
				stature. This is an empty space between the arms and waist, which should be
				in the form of a triangle, and if there is no deformation, they are
				symmetrical.
			</p>
			<p>
				The physician will also take a look at the symmetry of ribs’ arcs while the
				child is bent forward, as if moving to touch the feet. If there are bumps
				in the level of the ribs, especially if it is one-sided, it is a good
				indication of the presence of scoliosis.
			</p>
			<h3>
				How To Treat Scoliosis?
			</h3>
			<p>
				Scoliosis may be present in all seasons of life, but in the case of
				children, who are still in the growth phase, it can often be fully
				corrected. Children will be evaluated by a doctor based on clinical
				features, such as the age of the child as well as the progression of the
				deformity to determine the proper method of treatment.
			</p>
			<p>
				For the treatment of scoliosis, regardless of age, there are targeted
				corrective exercises which must be done correctly in order to take effect.
				Therefore they should be done under the supervision of a physiotherapist.
				These exercises can be done daily, but occasionally complete therapy is
				needed for fixing the backbone, pelvis and hip.
			</p>
			<p>
				Backstroke swimming may also be helpful, but it is to be done under
				professional supervision. The next option in the treatment of scoliosis is
				wearing an orthopedic corset. When the spine is curved, it is not easy to
				correct it, so the child, together with a program of exercises, may also
				wear a prosthetic leg.
			</p>
			<p>
				Scoliosis requires an individual approach to each patient, especially when
				it comes to children. For successful remediation of the spine, it is
				necessary that parents and therapist act together as a team.
			</p>
			<p>
				In some of the most severe cases, when the corrective exercises, swimming,
				wearing an orthopedic corset, do not give the intended results, or when the
				curvature of the spine is too large, surgery may be advised as a solution.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Treatment Of Scoliosis By Schroth Method
			</h3>
			<p>
				The Schroth method is an alternative method of treatment for scoliosis
				which is often successful. It is a physiotherapy treatment which employs
				the use of isometric exercises (muscle contractions without movement), and
				exercises for strengthening and stretching the asymmetric muscles.
			</p>
			<p>
				For each patient undergoing the Schroth method, an exercise program is
				specifically tailored to each individual patient. The Schroth method is
				conducted by first making postural corrections to correct the body in free
				space, and then to activate the muscles. Exercises are done in front of the
				mirror, while employing the use of rotational breathing. This type of
				treatment, along with other elements of other forms of treatment can lead
				to a successful correction of the problem.
